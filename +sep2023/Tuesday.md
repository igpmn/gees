# Tuesday model experiments

## Creating model object
* Composing a model object of model source files
* Preparser and preparsed model files
* Wrapper source files

## Steady state of a BGP model
* Autarky model
* Symmetric 2-area model
* Level and growth components of steady state
* Choosing a point on BGP

## Neutral comparative static (along growth drivers)
* Moving along the global population BGP line
* Moving along the global productivity BGP line
* Choosing a nominal level

## Parameterized comparative static
* Relative population
* Labor force assumptions
* Relative productivity, tradables/nontradables sectors
* Changing financial positions in multiarea versions

## Introductory dynamic simulations
* Spill-over of area-specific inflationary shocks
* Basic types of assumptions about information set evolution
