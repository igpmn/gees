# Plan for the September 2023 workshop

## Setting up computers

* Git
* IrisT
* GEES repository

## Review of the model structure

* Intro to Theoretical foundations
* GEES modules

## Review of model implementation in Matlab/IrisT

* Model source language
* Steady state with balanced growth path and unit roots
* Intro to nonlinear dynamic simulation techniques

## Existing infrastructure

* "Standard" versions of the model: 1A, 2S, 4G
* Parameter calibration
* Standard comparative static experiments
* Standard simulation experiments
* Reporting

## Simulating events affecting intertemporal choices

* Resource constraints shocks
* Discountingshocks
* Capital accumulation shocks
* Global vs regional, short lived vs long lived, anticipated vs unanticipated

## Simulating global context of monetary and fiscal policy events

* Monetary policy in the long run: disinflation
* Monetary policy over the cycles: zero floor, policy erros, falling behind
  the curve
* Fiscal policy in the long run: government debt

## Look at empirical patterns in intertemporal choice

* Consumption, investment, real interest rates
