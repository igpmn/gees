# :fontawesome-solid-children:  Demography



## Overview

The demography module determines the following population quantities; all
of them are considered to be simple exogenous processes not affected by the
rest of the model:

* Global population trend

* Area's total population

* Area's working age population

* Area's labor force (labor participation)


Endogenously within the model, we then model
per-worker labor supply (e.g. per-worker hours).
