# :fontawesome-solid-comment-dollar:  Monetary policy

The central bank uses a short-term local-currency interest rate as its key policy instruments to steer inflation towards an explicit or implicit inflation target. The monetary policy reaction function includes responses to

* deviations in the inflation forecast from the target
* deviations in nominal depreciation from its long-run sustainable level
* cycle in real economic activity measured by labor empoyed

The reaction function is first defined for an "unconstrained" policy rate
(i.e. an interest rate not bound to remain above its floor), and the actual
policy rate is then derived as a maximum of its unconstrained level
and the floor.
