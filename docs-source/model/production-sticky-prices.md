Downward sloping demand curve

$$
y_t 
= \extern{y}_t \, \left( \frac{py_t}{\extern{py}_t} \right)^{\left.-{\mu_{py}}\middle/\left(\mu_{py}-1\right)\right.} \,
$$

where

* $\mu_{py}$ is the monopoly power of the representative producer in its own
  market, and ${\left.{\mu_{py}}\middle/\left(\mu_{py}-1\right)\right.}$ is
  the underlying elasticity of substitution of demand for the producer's
  output (which gives rise to the monopoly power)

Period profits

$$
\Pi_{y0,t} \equiv \left( py_t  - py_{0,t}\right)\, y_t - \Xi_{py,t}
$$

with the price adjustment costs given by
$$
\Xi_{py,t}
\equiv \tfrac{1}{2} \, \xi_{py} \, 
\extern{py}_t \, \extern{y_t}\,
\bigl( \Delta \blog py_t - j_t \bigr)^2
$$

where $j_t$ is a price indexation factor given by

$$
j \equiv  \zeta_{py}\ \blog \roc{\extern{py}}_{t-1} + (1-\zeta_{py})
\,\blog \roc{py}_\ss
$$

Maximization problem

$$
\max\nolimits_{\{y_t, py_t\}}
\E_t \sum_t \left( \beta\, \betay_t\right)^t \, vh_t \, \Pi_{y0,t}
$$

where 

* $\beta_{y}$ is an additional discount factor to compensate for the
  uncertainty of cash flows generated by real economic activity


Optimal price setting with no adjustment cost (steady state) is a markup
over the marginal cost

$$
p_{y,t} = \mu_{py} \, p_{y0,t}
$$


Optimal price setting with adjusutment cost is a Phillips curve

$$
p_{y,t} \, \Bigl\{
1 + \left(\mu_{py}-1\right) \, \xi_{py} \Bigl[
\left(\bDelta \blog p_{y,t} - j_t \right)
- \beta \, \beta_{y} \left(\bDelta \blog p_{y,t+1} - j_{t+1} \right)
\Bigr] \Bigr\}
=
\mu_{py}\, p_{y0,t}
$$
