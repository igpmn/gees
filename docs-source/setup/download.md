# How to get GEES model files

The GEES model files are available from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Global-Projection-Model-Network/GEES).
Get the files down to your computer using one of the following ways.

## Recommended: Cloning the GEES repository

After installing [Git](https://git-scm.com) locally on your computer, clone
the GEES repository using this command

```
git clone https://github.com/Global-Projection-Model-Network/GEES ***FOLDER***
```

where you replace `***FOLDER***` with the desired target folder.

Cloning the repository using Git creates a link between your local folder
and the GitHub repository, and makes it extremely easy and convenient to
sync the files.

## Discouraged: Download a zip archive

Alternatively, you can use the old-school method of downloading and
unzipping an archive file from the repository website. Use the green Code
button, and select Download ZIP.

With a plain vanilla download, you have to manually repeat the process every single
time you need to sync the files.
